            <h2><strong>Ethics are critical</strong></h2>
            <p>And all this in an ethical way. We don’t want a life where we have an ad everywhere we look. We don’t want a world where computers know more about us than even we do. That’s why it’s critical that ads follow a series of guidelines, like making sure that they don’t try to trick people. Also, people need to know what information companies have, and very easily manage what information we’re given them, as well as deleting it whenever we want.</p>

            <h2><strong>Smart Ads for Smart Cities</strong></h2>
            <p>With all the buzz around smart cities, people are starting to worry about having advertisement everywhere. We’re imagining cities with screens everywhere, and in which a business model based on ads is predominant.</p>
            <p>Smart cities have an enormous potential in advertisement, and it’s important that we make use of it. Ads have gotten much more intelligent over the past few years, but in the world of Internet of Things, we can take this to a whole new level. We propose a system in which the ads displayed to a user are chosen based on the information received from different kinds of sensors like a temperature, proximity or humidity sensor.</p>

            <h2><strong>Administration Panel</strong></h2>
            <p>We're using the awesome Fi-Ware technologies to offer a very easy to use dashboard to administer the different ads on out platform. From there, you can add a new widget for every ad, and there handle the different conditions in which the ad will be shown on the different client screens.</p>
