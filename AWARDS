We built this project while in Campus Party Europe in London (2013) and we were awarded some prizes in the Hackathons:

-Hacking for Something Better -> Smart Cities: 2nd prize (600€)
-Fiware Hackathon -> Global 1st Prize (5000€) and Best Young Developers (2500€)
 
We want to thank Fiware for the incredible support and dedication, Futura Network and O2 for the awesome event they organized and to everybody who believed in us. 

Thank you.
Braulio, Alex, Alberto and Jorge.
